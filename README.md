# MyKeyboard

an android software keyboard for Vim and Busybox sh.

* QWERTY layout keyboard for tablets.
* requires android 4.1.2 or more.
* developing under Android Studio 2.2.2.
* an etude. this is not usable now.

do not use in ordinary text editor,
because this keyboard sends raw control characters to edit field.

i want to implement flick shift and flick ctrl,
but current implementation is shift lock and ctrl lock.
